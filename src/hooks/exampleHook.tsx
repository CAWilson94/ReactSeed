/** 
 * From version 16.8, React Hooks are officially added to React. Besides built-in Hooks such as: useState, useEffect, useCallback…, we can define our own hooks to use state and other React features without writing a class.

A Custom Hook has following features:

As a function, it takes input and returns output.
Its name starts with use like useQuery, useMedia…
Unlike functional components, custom hooks return a normal, non-jsx data.
Unlike normal functions, custom hooks can use other hooks such as useState, useRef… and other custom hooks.
You can see that some libraries also provide hooks such as useForm (React Hook Form), useMediaQuery (MUI), useQuery (React Query).
